I was on a code review spree,
When I encountered some code by O.G.
The code that I saw, was not in anyway poor,
And reviewing it filled me with glee.

I looked at some code by the frenchie,
And this code it impressed me immensely,
He now works with me, so no more French will I see,
Well, at least not as long as I'm friendly.   

There was a young man named Valters,
Who was well known in some quarters,
As a coder extreme, who codes like a dream,
I'm one of his many supporters,

Dear Alan, who has code that is new,
Lets see what your code can do,
Your code doesn't irk, looks like it will work,  
Regards, Rob (who is doing reviews).  

As I saw the change done by Nour,
I thought that I want to see more,
After much appraising, the change is amazing,
I give you a really high score.  

It's great working with Urwa Dar,
Especially when she goes Mah-Na Mah-Na,
It sets me off singing, and then we are winning,
But for everyone else it does jar...

My colleague who is named Urwa Dar,
Is a job posting super star,
Her code is complete, and looks really neat,
This lady is going to go far,

I consider myself a big fan,
Of the guy who is known as Neuman,
I looked at his change, and it was not strange,
Everything is now going to plan.

I love being a coding bystander,
When I see code by the great Aleksandar,
He's drank the moonshine, so I won't decline,
This work could not be much grander. 

I have a colleague called Marc,
On whose code I had to remark,
[He's better than Danny, who was not very canny, 
He's here for a while, and that makes me smile]
I'm approving this code on a lark.

I worked with someone named Chris,
Reviewing his code was pure bliss,
The code from this chappie, makes me so happy,
There is obviously nothing amiss.

Let me tell you a story about,
Someone who leaves me no doubt,
He's always pissed off, his name is Christophe!!!
And his code is good to go out.

There was a young man named Danny,
Who when coding, needed no nanny,
He fixed all the bugs, he needed no hugs,
It turned out his coding was canny. 

At first I wasn't too sure,
When I saw the change done by Nour,
But I looked again, and that was when,
I realised that it was not poor. 

One thing you can say about Dino,
Is that he does not have much of an ego,
[He beats me at chess, my game is a mess,
He works with a smile, and his code does compile,]
He is one of my favourite amigos

There was a young guy named Vik/Rick,
Whose coding skills were real slick,
His code got a review, the reviewer went woo!
So it was given a great big green tick

I spotted some code done by Rage,
And I found my attention engaged,
After doing a check, I saw it was correct,
He is certainly earning his wage.

There was a young guy named Matt,
Who wrote some code as he sat,
Rob saw it was super, oh what a trooper,
Commit and it will take care of that

There once was a coder named Liza,
Who found a little brainteaser,
She solved it real quick, her solution was slick,
It turns out she's an overachiever

I came across some of the work,
Done by my colleague named Kirk,
If I said it was crap, and should be put in the scrap,
I would just be a lying jerk

A guy joined our team for a while,
And I worried about their coding style.
But then I did a review, and my confidence grew,
And I approved their code with a smile

I was working when I came across,
Some code that was certainly not dross,
It looked really sweet, oh what a treat,
To review some work by my boss.

I hope I am not too toward,
When I talk of my colleague called Lord,
He's changed some stuff, I bet it was tough,
His work, I do greatly adore.


One thing I don't want to join, 
Is the work for the board Leboncoin,
I don't envy you, when you work with such poo,
I bet it feel like a kick to the groin?

A guy on the app support team,
Did a change that they thought was supreme,
It turned out that it, was good to commit,
Go ahead, it should work like a dream.

My monitor screen, it did glow,
Then I spotted your wonderful code,
What a sight to see, it fills me with glee,
The time you put in really shows,

To the person in Broadbean's employ,
Your code is a wonderful joy,
It feels me with pleasure, your change is so clever,
Go on now and do a deploy.

From someone who is a bit of a singer,
Who is lucky to work with a winner,
I didn't know that you could, make code look so good,
You certainly aren't a beginner,

Praise will soon be forthcoming,
For code that looks a bit stunning,
It's concise and it's neat, oh what a feat!
The author is showing his cunning.  

I may be a little deranged,
But when I saw how your code was arranged,
It made me orgasmic, and that was really fantastic,
The system can now be changed.

As I looked at your change in the queue,
I realise now that I knew,
That my code was lacking, perhaps I am slacking,
I wish I could write code like you.

This poem is your appointed perk,
For doing some excellent work,
Your code is divine, and is a definite sign,
That you are not trying to shirk.

I was singing like some sort of queen,
When I encountered some code on my screen,
I'm in need of a rhyme, so I think it is time,
To add to the code at Broadbean.

If I could just be so bold,
To point out how you have tolled,
Your work is the best, you've passed the test,
Oh! What a sight to behold!

We are all under a lot of stress,
As the ticket queue is a mess,
The workload is heavy, the tickets are many,
But this review will help there be less  

I was sitting right here in my chair,
When I saw your code right there,
Checked it once, checked it twice, it looked really nice,
Approval would only be fair.

I looked at your code, it's so smart,
It's like a fine piece of art,
This change is so foo and not at all poo,
It really touches my heart. 

I looked at your code, it was splendid,
And oh, so expertly tended,
What I saw with my eyes, was a great surprise
Soon this work will be ended

Your code is looking divine,
It's so much better than mine,
I don't think it is shit, so if you are happy with it,
Commit and all will be fine.

Your excellent work has me cowed,
It really stands out from the crowd,
It looks really wow!  Go on, take a bow,
Put it live, stand up and be proud,

In an effort to see Homer Simpson,
Let's put this ticket to extinction,
The work's up to par, I give it A star, 
And pass your code with distinction,

I wanted to review this real quick,
So I wrote out a brief limerick,
I think that I'm brill, and have great rhyming skill
But you probably think I'm a dick

This change makes me think très bon,
I so admire your change to the cron,
Your change is insightful, oh how delightful!
Merge now and this work will be gone.

I read the text that you wrote,
It was concise and it lacked any bloat,
It looked really nice, so I read it twice 
It certainly gets my vote.  

I don't need any more information,
To approve your work on translations,
We've increased our support, for that foreign port,
Your change provides aspiration.  

Your first attempt was like slime,
What you posted was a coding crime,
But you pulled through, after a bit of a clue,
For this bit of code it is time.     

The update to that url,
Seems to have gone quite well,
This work was piss, so get rid of this,
This change is gonna be swell

I see that you're a go-getter,
But I hope that you're also a trend-setter,
Broadbean's code is all horrid, and a little bit torrid,
But removing that hack makes it better. 

The client expressed a big preference,
For the way that we send our reference,
In an attempt to appease, and put the client at ease,
You've done this change with great deference.

I was very much taken aback,
By the code that I saw on my Mac,
You've made no mistake, it looks really great,
Even though it's just changing a hack 

Oh what a miraculous deed,
You've done in updating this feed,
I speak from the heart, your change is so smart
Commit this now with great speed.

I tried but I could not resist,
Reviewing your change to that list,
Your code is the best, and solves the request,
And I'm happy that I could assist

Fulfilling the role of inspector,
I've looked at the update of that sector,
It looks really cool, your code makes me drool,
"Commit it? I don't give a feck, sir!"

I looked at your code and I thought,
There are no mistakes to be caught,
You've handled that data, so I'll see you later,
Go on and update this report.

Approval was not a hard sell,
After reading your SQL,
There is not much that is greater, than updating some data,
This day is going to be swell.

Our templates can be such an arse,
And the work sometimes feels like a farce,
When a token ain't there, it really ain't fair,
But you've fixed it by changing force parse.

An error occurred at the board,
But we did not have it stored,
After working a bit, you've classified it, 
I think you deserve an award

I think you deserve some acclaim,
For working around a board that was lame,
You've added code to parse, which can be a bit of an arse,
We now know the candidate's name.

As I looked at your code for delete,
I thought, oh that code is complete
The jobs can be killed, just wait for the build,
That deploys your wonderful feat.  

I know that this work was a bore,
But what a change to the advertise for,
You've done it real sweet, you're kinda elite,
Now you've just got to finish this chore

I looked at the change, to that PJB,
As I sat at the office, in South Quay,
You updated that site, and it looks alright,
Let's hope that the client agrees.  

There is a hack for a board called Monster,
That keeps getting longer and longer,
We add clients each day, and we constantly pray,
That the code for this feed will get stronger. 

You've made a change to BA,
Let's hope that it goes okay,
This feed is a bitch, and is the sort of thing which,
When you commit it you just have to pray.

I looked at your change and thought damn,
No more will this guy send us spam,
It's really cool, that you've blacklisted that fool, 
Our clients won't fall for their scam.  

I looked at the delete by my mate,
To fix the failure in user migrate,
If we had a fix, so we could miss out this trick,
It would really be great

Oh my! How you have slogged,
You have reduced the amount we have logged,
You've made it more silent, without being violent,
Our logs will now be less clogged.

Oh my! How you have slogged,
You have increased the amount we have logged,
I hope that you're proud, you've made it more loud,
Let's hope that your issue's defogged.

In your job, you were bidden,
To make that salary hidden,
It's quite outstanding, that they named it banding, 
That name should be put in the midden.  

While I was in the office, at South Quay,
I carried out some search UAT,
This work wasn't exciting, or very enlightening, 
You're lucky I don't charge a fee.

It's a shame that this work is still going,
And it's all down to a lack of us knowing,
If the spec had been right, then maybe we might,
Have not had this ticket keep growing.







I worked with a Mr Daz Westall,
And up to the top he did crawl,
He's now leaving the bean, to go bust his spleen,
Running a business that's small.

I worked with a guy known as Daz,
And this guy he had a lot of pizzaz,
He's not known for sports, but he is for ripped shorts,
And soon, the great business he has.   

To Darren, who once was my boss,
You leaving will be a great loss,
You've left us all alone, now that you've flown,
But I bet that you don't give a toss.

We are losing our CTO,
As he has said that he now must go,
He's off by himself, but he's not on the shelf
Provided his business does grow. 

Darren's great plans are unfurled,
He's running a start up with perl,
From Broadbean he fled, to work from his shed, 
And see more of his small little girl.

Broadbean has suffered a blow,
As we are losing our CTO,
I need to get off my chest, that he is the best
I wish that he wouldn't go

Darren's leaving is a bit of a curse,
There is not a lot that is worse,
Goodbye my friend, but at last I can end
This week of extremely bad verse.   






I hope that Shaminie is sure,
When it comes to marrying Nour,
May they be blessed, I wish them the best,
With their happy l'amour.



I have joyous news here to spread,
As Valters is soon getting wed,
With Inga as his wife, he'll have a good life,
I see lots of good times ahead.

I worked with a guy known as Nick,
Who got things done real quick,
First time it was Phil, this time it is real,
I preferred it when this was a trick.  

I worked with this Italian dame,
Who had an un-rhymable name,
An email was sent, and then off she went,
Which I personally think is a shame.  

I write this as it has to be noted,
That Sanchez is being promoted,
He's our App Support star, and works really hard,
And deserves it because he's devoted.


I worked with a guy known as Pat
Who is leaving to work in his flat,
But we should not mourn, he's now working with porn,
And videos chock full of skat¹

I worked with a guy known as Kirk,
Who did some excellent work,
But now he is leaving, and the business is grieving,
Why must he be such a jerk?

I worked with a guy known as Ben,
He raised tickets again and again,
We also played chess, which helped relieve stress
And now he is leaving.  Amen. 

I worked with a guy known as Steve,
Who left to go work at Indeed,
He's chasing more pay, and I just have to say,
That his leaving will cause me to grieve.   

I worked with a guy known as Phil,
Who got things done with his indomitable will
It might sound a bit sappy, but I would be happy
If the next guy has half of his skill.   

I worked with a lady called Julie,
And her work she always did duly,
She was a good member of staff, and a bit of a laugh,
And I'm going to miss this gal, truly.   

I worked with a guy known as Rage,
Who at times did not properly engage,
He acted all tough, but then left in a huff,
He should really be acting his age.

I met a guy at Broadbean,
This guy he always seemed keen,
He's off to Lumesse, leaving us in a mess,
Fuck you Brian!

I worked with a guy known as James,
The system he worked hard to tame,
The shit got much better, then he gave in his letter,
He felt he had achieved all his aims.

There once was a coder I knew,
Whose code was a little bit foo,
Sometimes it is great, and sometimes I just hate,
Cos his foo turns out to be poo.

I once had a colleague called Ashley,
Who posted some code that was ghastly,
His code was all shit, there were such problems with it,
Let's hope that he improves vastly

I once had a colleague called Alan,
Who at lunch, drank beer by the gallon,
He was flaky as shit, and then he did quit,
What a fucking arsehole.  

I hope I am not too toward,
When I talk of my colleague called Lord,
I am still grieving, as he said he was leaving,
His code will be greatly adored.

I worked with a guy named Paul,
And tormenting him was so cool,
But then he left, and I was bereft,
As I so enjoyed being cruel.

Let me tell you a story about,
Someone who's a bit of a lout,
He's always pissed off, his name is Christophe!!!
And I'm sad that he is now out.  

At work, I knew a guy who liked beer,
And I gave an almighty cheer,
It was as easy as mud, to drag him down the pub,
But now he's off to a land full of deer.

I once worked with a guy known as Vik,
Who liked to play all sorts of tricks,
They were very numerous, but not very humorous,
He pretty much was a big dick.  

I worked with Gareth Harper,
And this guy could not have been sharper,
It occasionally showed, that he hated our code,
He finally managed to scarper,


I worked with a guy who looked eight,
Despite this he did work that was great,
His name is Jules, and his cocktails rule,
He's leaving so now him I hate.
